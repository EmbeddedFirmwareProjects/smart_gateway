<< Opertions >>
    - Serial Port selection
        - In the default configuration both the UART and SPI ports are configured for serial port operation. 
        - Uart selection            
            - serial data goes out the UART until the device asserts the SPI_SSEL signal.
        - Spi selection
            - If you hold DOUT low during boot, then the device only uses the SPI. 
            - If you enable only the SPI, the device uses only the SPI, and it ignores UART communications. 
            - Once SPI is in use, do not attempt to apply changes (AC) which change the UART or SPI settings
        
    - UART flow control
        - CTS flow control provides an indication to the host to stop sending serial data to the device. 
        - RTS flow control allows the host to signal the device to not send data in the serial transmit buffer out the UART.
        - To enable RTS/CTS flow control, use the D6 and D7 commands
        
<< Serial interface protocols >>
    - Transparent operating mode
        - When operating in Transparent mode, the devices act as a serial line replacement. 
        - The device queues up all UART or SPI data received through the DIN or MOSI pin for RF transmission. 
        - When RF data is received, the device sends the data out through the serial port. 
        - Use the Command mode interface to configure the device configuration parameters.
        - Note:: Transparent operation is not provided when using the SPI.

    - API operating mode
        - API operating mode is an alternative to Transparent operating mode. 
        - The frame-based API extends the level to which a host application can interact with the networking capabilities of the device.

<< Modes of Operation >>
    - Idle mode 
        - When not receiving or transmitting data, the device is in Idle mode.
        - During Idle mode, the device listens for valid data on both the RF and serial ports.

    - Transmit Mode (Serial data in the serial receive buffer is ready to be packetized)
        - Prior to transmitting the data, the module ensures that a 16-bit network address and route to the destination node have been established.
        - If you do not know the destination 16-bit network address known, network address discovery takes place. 
        - If you do not know the a route is not known, route discovery takes place for the purpose of establishing a route to the destination node.
        - If a device with a matching network address is not discovered, it discards the packet.
        - The device transmits the data once a route is established. If route discovery fails to establish a route, the device discards the packet.
        - When ZigBee data is transmitted from one node to another, the destination node transmits a network-level acknowledgment.
        - If the source node does not receive a network acknowledgment, it retransmits the data.

    - Receive mode
        - This is the default mode for the XBee/XBee-PRO ZigBee RF Module. 
        - The device is in Receive mode when it is not transmitting data.
        - If a destination node receives a valid RF packet, the destination node transfers the data to its serial transmit buffer.
    
    - Command Mode (Command Mode Sequence is issued, not available when using the SPI port)
        - Command mode is a state in which the firmware interprets incoming characters as commands. It is only available over the UART when not using the Smart Energy firmware.
            - Enter Command mode
                - issue the following sequence: +++ and observe guard times before and after the command character.
                - The default sequence to transition to Command mode is:
                    - No characters sent for one second [GT (Guard Times) parameter = 0x3E8]
                    - Input three plus characters (+++) within one second [CC (Command Sequence Character) parameter = 0x2B.]
                    - No characters sent for one second [GT (Guard Times) parameter = 0x3E8]
                - When you send the Command mode sequence, the device sends OK out the UART pin.
                - The device may delay sending the OK if it has not transmitted all of the serial data it received.
                - When the device is in Command mode, it starts the Command mode timer (CT command) and can receive AT commands on the UART port.
                - You can customize the command character, the guard times and the timeout in the device’s configuration settings.
            - Failure to enter Command mode is often due to baud rate mismatch.
            - Ensure that the baud rate of the connection matches the baud rate of the device. By default, the BD parameter = 3(9600).
        - Send AT commands
            Format:: Prefix(AT)+ASCIICommand+Space(optional)+parameter(opetional,Hex)+CarriageReturn
            example::ATDL1F<CR>
            - To store the new value to non-volatile (long term) memory, send the WR (Write) command.
            - This allows parameter values that you modify to persist in the device's registry after a reset.
            - Otherwise, the device restores parameters to the previous values after a reset.
        - Response to AT commands
            - If the command runs successfully, the device returns an OK message.
            - If the command errors, the device returns an ERROR message.
        - Apply command changes
            - Any changes you make to the configuration command registers using AT commands do not take effect until you apply the changes.
            - To apply changes:
                1. Send the AC (Apply Changes) command.
                or:
                2. Exit Command mode.
        - Exit Command mode
            1. Send the CN (Exit Command Mode) command followed by a carriage return.
            or:
            2. If the device does not receive any valid AT commands within the time specified by CT (Command Mode Timeout), it returns to Idle Mode
        
    - Sleep Mode
        - Sleep modes allow the device to enter states of low power consumption when not in use.
    
    
<< ZigBee networking concepts >> 
    - Coordinator
        - Starts the network, selecting the channel and PAN ID (both 64-bit and 16-bit).
    - Router 
    - End device
    - ZigBee networks may have any number of end devices.
    - In fact, a network can be composed of one coordinator, multiple end devices, and zero routers.
    - The coordinator and routers can allow other devices to join the network and can route data.
    - The router or coordinator that allowed an end device to join becomes the “parent” of the end device.
    - By default, the device operates as a router in transparent mode. 
    - To select coordinator operation, set CE to 1. 
    - To select end device operation, set SM to a non-zero value. To select router operation, both CE and SM must be 0.
    - If a device is a coordinator and it needs to be changed into an end device, CE you must first set it back to 0. 
    - If not, the SM configuration will conflict with the CE configuration. Likewise, to change an end device into a coordinator, you must change it into a router first.

    - API frame format
        - The firmware supports two API operating modes: without escaped characters and with escaped characters.
            - AP = 1: API operation.
            - AP = 2: API operation (with escaped characters—only possible on UART).
